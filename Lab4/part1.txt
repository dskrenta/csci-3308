1. Give div1 a new background color. What css rule did you use? How would you write it
in a css file so that only this div gets the new background color?
2. Edit the margin and padding attributes of the divs. What does changing the margin do?
What does changing the padding do?
● Now change the background color of the <p> element inside div 1 to yellow.
3. Change the margin and padding of the yellow <p>. What happens if the margin is
greater than 100px? What happens if the padding is greater than 100px?
4. Keeping the padding greater than 100px, change the overflow of div1. What is the
difference between scroll and hidden?
● Refresh the page to return the divs to their original states.
5. Give all divs the float: left attribute. What order are they in? What if they all have the
float: right attribute instead?
6. Keeping all divs with the float: right attribute, give each one in turn the two attributes
float: left and clear: right. Describe the relative positions of the boxes with each
combination.
7. Refresh the page and recreate the arrangement of divs
shown in the picture on the right:
What attributes do the divs have?
● Refresh the page to return the divs to their original states.
8. Give the body element a margin value of 0px. What changes? What does this tell you
about the default margin value?
